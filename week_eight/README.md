## Time for level up - Advance JS

### Closures and IIFEs

#### Understanding closures

- A closure is a function that makes use of variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned.

In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters. The inner function can access these variables even after the outer function has returned. Here's an example:

```js
function outer() {
  var message = "Hello"

  function inner() {
    console.log(message)
  }

  return inner
}

var innerFunction = outer()
innerFunction() // outputs "Hello"
```

In this example, outer is a function that defines a variable message and returns an inner function inner. When outer is called, it returns inner, which is assigned to the variable innerFunction. When innerFunction is called, it outputs the value of message, which is "Hello". This is possible because of closures. The inner function inner has access to the message variable even though outer has already returned.

#### Private Variables using Closures

Closures can be used to create private variables in JavaScript. A private variable is a variable that can only be accessed by the functions defined in the same scope. Here's an example:

```js
function counter() {
  var count = 0

  function increment() {
    count++
    console.log(count)
  }

  function decrement() {
    count--
    console.log(count)
  }

  return {
    increment: increment,
    decrement: decrement
  }
}

var counterObject = counter()
counterObject.increment() // outputs 1
counterObject.increment() // outputs 2
counterObject.decrement() // outputs 1
```

In this example, counter is a function that defines a variable count and returns an object with two methods increment and decrement. The increment and decrement methods both have access to the count variable because of closures. However, the count variable is not accessible outside of the counter function. This means that count is a private variable.

#### IIFEs

IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. An IIFE is a function that is defined and immediately executed. Here's an example:

```js
;(function () {
  console.log("Hello, world!")
})()
```

In this example, an anonymous function is defined and immediately executed. The function simply outputs "Hello, world!" to the console. The () at the end of the function definition is what executes the function immediately.

IIFEs are often used to create a new scope for variables and functions, so they don't interfere with the global scope. Here's an example:

```js
;(function () {
  var message = "Hello, world!"

  function printMessage() {
    console.log(message)
  }

  printMessage()
})()
```

In this example, an anonymous function is defined and immediately executed. Inside the function, a variable message and a function printMessage are defined. These variables and functions are only accessible inside the anonymous function and do not interfere with the global scope. The printMessage function is called at the end of the anonymous function, which outputs the value of message.

here's a simple real-world example of an IIFE:

```js
;(function () {
  var currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()
  console.log("Welcome to my website! Â© " + currentYear)
})()
```

In this example, we define an IIFE that sets the currentYear variable to the current year using the Date() function. The IIFE then logs a welcome message to the console, including the copyright symbol and the current year.

This is a simple example, but you'll often see IIFEs used in real-world applications to encapsulate code and prevent naming conflicts, particularly in larger codebases or when using third-party libraries. They can also be used to initialize variables, set up event listeners, or perform other tasks that should only happen once at the beginning of the script.

#### Real Word Example

```js
function createPerson(name, age) {
  var privateData = {
    address: "Unknown",
    phone: "Unknown"
  }

  function getPrivateData() {
    return privateData
  }

  return {
    getName: function () {
      return name
    },
    getAge: function () {
      return age
    },
    setAddress: function (address) {
      privateData.address = address
    },
    setPhone: function (phone) {
      privateData.phone = phone
    },
    getPrivateData: getPrivateData
  }
}

var person = createPerson("John", 30)
console.log(person.getName()) // outputs "John"
console.log(person.getAge()) // outputs 30
person.setAddress("123 Main St")
person.setPhone("555-555-1212")
console.log(person.getPrivateData()) // outputs { address: '123 Main St', phone: '555-555-1212' }
```

In this example, createPerson is a function that returns an object with methods to get and set the person's name, age, address, and phone. The private data (the person's address and phone number) is stored in a closure that can only be accessed by the object's methods. The getPrivateData method returns the private data, but it can only be called from within the closure.

This use of closures allows us to create objects with private data and methods, which can be useful in situations where we want to restrict access to certain information or functionality.

### Asynchronous Programming

#### Synchronous vs asynchronous code

Synchronous code executes one instruction at a time, waiting for each instruction to complete before moving on to the next one. Here's an example of synchronous code that logs a message to the console:

```js
console.log("Hello")
console.log("World")
```

In this example, the first `console.log()` statement is executed before the second one, and the output is:

```
Hello
World
```

Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows multiple instructions to be executed at the same time, without waiting for each instruction to complete before moving on to the next one. Here's an example of asynchronous code that uses the setTimeout() function to delay the execution of a function:

```js
console.log("Hello")
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("World")
}, 1000)
```

In this example, the `console.log()` statement is executed first, and then the setTimeout() function is called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). After 1 second, the callback function is executed, logging "World" to the console. The output is:

```
Hello
World
```

### Callbacks for Handling Async Behavior

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when certain actions are completed. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the completion of an async operation. Here's an example of using a callback to log the contents of a file:

```js
const fs = require("fs")

fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8", function (err, data) {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(data)
})
```

In this example, the `readFile()` function takes a file path, encoding type, and a callback function as arguments. When the file is read, the callback function is executed, logging the contents of the file to the console. If there's an error reading the file, the callback function throws an error.

### Promises for Async Operations

Promises are a way of handling async operations in JavaScript. Promises represent a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved in the future. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Heres an example of using a Promise to fetch data from an API:

```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error))
```

In this example, we use the `fetch()` function to make an HTTP request to an API. The `fetch()` function returns a Promise, which we can chain with `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. The first `.then()` method parses the response body as JSON. The second `.then()` method logs the data to the console. The `.catch()` method logs any errors to the console.

### Using Async/Await for Simplifying Async Code

Async/await is a way of handling async operations in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. Here's an example of using async/await to fetch data from an API:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    const data = await response.json()
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}

fetchData()
```

In this example, we define an async function called `fetchData()` that uses the await keyword to wait for the Promise returned by `fetch()` to resolve. We then use the await keyword again to wait for the Promise returned by response.json() to resolve. We can then use the retrieved data as if it were synchronous code. The try...catch block allows us to handle any errors that may occur during the async operation.

Heres another example that uses async/await to read a file:

```js
const fs = require("fs")

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.promises.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8")
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}

readFile()
```

In this example, we use the `fs.promises.readFile()` function to read a file asynchronously. We define an async function called `readFile()` that uses the await keyword to wait for the Promise returned by `fs.promises.readFile()` to resolve. We can then use the retrieved data as if it were synchronous code. The try...catch block allows us to handle any errors that may occur during the async operation.

Async/await is a powerful tool for simplifying async code and making it easier to read and understand.


## Template Literals and Destructuring

### Interpolating strings with template literals:

Template literals, introduced in ES6, provide a convenient way to interpolate variables and expressions within strings. Instead of concatenating strings and variables using the plus (+) operator, you can enclose the string within backticks (`) and use placeholders (${expression}) to embed variables or expressions directly into the string. Here's an example:

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 25;
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
```

The output will be: "My name is John and I'm 25 years old."

### Extracting data from objects and arrays using destructuring:
Destructuring is a way to extract individual values from objects or arrays into separate variables. It provides a concise syntax to access nested data structures easily. Here are a couple of examples:

```javascript

// Destructuring objects
const person = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 25

// Destructuring arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second, third] = numbers;
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(third); // Output: 3
```

## Map, Set, and WeakMap:

### Understanding the Map data structure

The Map data structure in JavaScript allows you to store key-value pairs. It differs from objects in that the keys can be of any type, and it maintains the insertion order of elements. Here's an example:
```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set('name', 'John');
myMap.set('age', 25);

console.log(myMap.get('name')); // Output: John
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 2
console.log(myMap.has('age')); // Output: true
myMap.delete('name');
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 1
```

### Using Map, Set, and WeakMap collections

- Maps: Maps are useful for scenarios where you need to associate values with specific keys and perform operations based on those keys.
- Sets: Sets store unique values and can be helpful when you need to track a collection of distinct elements or perform operations like union, intersection, or difference.
- WeakMaps: WeakMaps are similar to Maps but have some differences in behavior. They only accept objects as keys, and the references to the keys are weak, allowing them to be garbage collected if no other references exist.

### Array Methods and Iterators

Array methods such as map, reduce, and filter:
Array methods in JavaScript provide powerful tools for manipulating and transforming arrays. Here are a few commonly used methods:

- `map()`: Applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results.
- `reduce()`: Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function to each element and accumulating the result.
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test specified by a provided function.

Iterating over arrays with forEach and others:
JavaScript provides multiple ways to iterate over arrays:

- forEach(): Calls a provided function once for each element in an array.
- for...of: A loop construct introduced in ES6 that allows iterating over iterable objects, including arrays.
- Other methods like map(), reduce(), and filter() mentioned earlier also involve iteration over arrays implicitly.

## Error Handling:

### Understanding try-catch blocks:
Error handling is crucial in JavaScript to handle and manage unexpected issues that may arise during program execution. The try-catch block provides a structured way to catch and handle errors. The code within the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it's caught by the corresponding catch block. Here's an example:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
}
```

### Throwing and catching errors:
You can manually throw errors using the throw statement, which allows you to create custom error messages or propagate built-in errors. The thrown error can be caught and handled using the try-catch block. Example:

```javascript
try {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message); // Output: Something went wrong!
}
```

### Debugging with stack traces:
When an error occurs, JavaScript provides a stack trace that shows the sequence of function calls leading to the error. It can be helpful for debugging by identifying the exact location and order of function calls. Stack traces can be accessed through the stack property of an Error object.
