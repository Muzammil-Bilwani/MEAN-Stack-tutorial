## Example for Input and Output

1. Function to sum all even numbers in an array:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: 30

2. Function to count the number of vowels in a string:
Input: "hello world"
Output: 3

3. Function to find the length of the longest string in an array:
Input: ["apple", "banana", "pear", "grapefruit"]
Output: 10

4. Function to find the average of all the numbers in an array:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 3

5. Function to return an array of all the keys in an object:
Input: { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" }
Output: ["name", "age", "city"]

6. Function to return an array of all the values for a specified key in each object:
Input: [{ name: "John", age: 30 }, { name: "Mary", age: 25 }, { name: "Peter", age: 35 }]
Output: ["John", "Mary", "Peter"]

7. Function to return an array of all the unique strings in an array:
Input: ["apple", "banana", "apple", "pear", "pear", "orange"]
Output: ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange"]

8. Function to return the product of all the numbers in an array:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 120

### How to do it. 

- Create a single file with name `main.js`
- Create different function for each question
    - For Example:

```js
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.
function sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers) {
    // Your code goes here
}
```

- Write your code in the function
- Call the function with the input and print the output
- For Example:

```js
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.
sumOfEvenNumbers([1,2,3,4,5,7,7,3])
```

- Run the code using `node main.js` command
- You should see the output in the terminal
- Upload the code over github. 
- Share your URL in slack.
